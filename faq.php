                                        Decentralized Finance or “Defi” (deaf-eye) is a novel financial system that operates independently and does not rely on centralized financial intermediaries like banks, credit unions, or insurance funds. Instead, users have the ability to transfer, trade, invest, and transact peer to peer using cryptocurrencies and digital assets via automated smart contracts, eliminating the need for these slow and costly intermediaries.

                                    <p>Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralized database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology.</p>

                                    <p>The proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many tokens he or she holds. This means that the more SMS token owned by a holder, the more mining power he or she has in the staking pool.How much can I earn monthly from the ecosystem?There are no guaranteed fixed percentages or amount you can earn monthly from the ecosystem as a token holder. This is not a Ponzi scheme or MLM, this is a legal business and monthly earning comes from fees with the ecosystem. 40% of fees are distributed to token holders by providing liquidity on listed exchanges. The greater your tokens, the greater your share in the staking pool.Note: Early stages token buyers stand the chance to earn more as token prices are cheaper.</p>
